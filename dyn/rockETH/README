# Rocket Dynamics Model

This folder contains a continuous-time rocket dynamics model based on quaternion orientation and thrust vector control. It is used for simulation, control, and estimation research related to agile rocket systems.

## Description

The core model is adapted from the **CRS** project developed at ETH Zurich. The original work is described in the following publication:

> _Chronos and CRS: Design of a miniature car-like robot and a software framework for single and multi-agent robotics and control_,
> ETH Zurich Research Collection, 2023.
> [Research Collection Link](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/644929)
> Presented at the 40th IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2023), London, United Kingdom.
